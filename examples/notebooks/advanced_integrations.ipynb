    "\n",
    "1. Using AgentForce as a tool in LangChain\n",
    "2. Building a customer support workflow with LangGraph that incorporates AgentForce\n",
    "3. Enhancing AgentForce with RAG capabilities using LlamaIndex\n",
    "4. Creating a hybrid system that combines all three frameworks\n",
    "5. Designing an integrated AgentForce agent that leverages these capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "These integrations enable powerful capabilities such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Smart routing of customer inquiries\n",
    "* Access to external knowledge bases\n",
    "* Multi-agent coordination\n",
    "* Stateful conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement this in a production environment, you would need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Deploy the integrated AgentForce agent to Salesforce\n",
    "2. Set up a service to handle the LlamaIndex knowledge base\n",
    "3. Configure webhooks to connect external systems with the AgentForce agent\n",
    "4. Implement authentication and security measures\n",
